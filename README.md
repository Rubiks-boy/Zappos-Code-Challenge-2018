My submission for the 2018 Zappos Code Challenge, placing me first.

The challenge was to program a caululator that, given a set of chefs and parameters, would find the winning chef in Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen.

Winners were determined by who submitted a solution first that could solve the provided 13 puzzles. I ended up placing first out of several dozen high school and college students, among them people studying for graduate degrees in CS. The challenge was held on March 6, 2018.
